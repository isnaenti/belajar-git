## About the PHP Template

Nbg's PHP template is a minimal host template that serves a simple .html index page

That page is consisted by three links which you can click and then a php function is called which makes a call to NBG's API

In order to create your personal sandbox in your project you need to change the REPLACE_THIS_VALUE parameter of the .php files to match your personal data

The response of your calls will be visible in a new browser window

Have fun coding in your browser!
